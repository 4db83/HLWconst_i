# Holston, Laubach and Williams' (HLWs) model with constant policy rate $i$

This repo contains R code from https://www.newyorkfed.org/medialibrary/media/research/economists/williams/data/HLW_Code.zip, which was modified to produce natural rate (rstar or $r^{\ast}_t$) estimates from HLWs model but with a constant policy rate from 2008:Q1 onwards. In this model, the natural rate is driven entirely by the nominal interest rate $i_t$, that is, the policy rate set by the federal reserve.

All files are in their original format as donwloaded from the above HLW_Code.zip link and only the "run.hwl.R" file is modified to incorporate the constant interest rate counterfactual.
